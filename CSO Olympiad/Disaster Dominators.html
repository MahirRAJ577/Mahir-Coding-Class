        <h1 class="centre">Our Game</h1>
        <p>The project we created is a fun filled game about dominating disasters- it's a new twist on ordinary education. Our researchers collected facts on the Caribbean's most infamous natural disasters. This research was then used to create a game in which the player would have to collect items that will assist them in their survival. If you were told that a natural disaster was rapidly approaching, a flash flood for instance, chances are you won’t know what to do in that situation. Our game can help you in that regard as it is all about preparations for such geo hazards and as a parting gift for each disaster, you will be given a mini game to complete afterwards. Although our game is only about how to prepare for said natural disasters, right here on our website, we have a link to a PowerPoint presentation with much more information and details with things like: how many times each natural disaster occurs each year; how to make a complete survival kit for a natural disaster and; how to survive each one. We hope you enjoy our game and check out the PowerPoint presentation.

        <h1 class="centre">Instructions</h1>
        <p>Once you are on the main menu, choose the natural disaster that will be surviving. You can use the arrows on either side of the screen to move to different rooms. Items can be picked up by clicking them. Once, you have obtained all the items, you will begin one of the three (3) minigames depending on the natural disaster you chose.</p>
